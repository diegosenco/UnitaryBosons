Test that the analytical integral leading to h_corr (Eq. XX) can be obtained also by direct numerical quadrature.

Note that the numerical integration is done on cubic boxes of different sizes. There can be some FAIL in the output files, for small cubic sizes, but all the tests succeed for large size.
